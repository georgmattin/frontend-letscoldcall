Script:
"${scriptContent}"

Please analyze this script and generate exactly 5 realistic objections that prospects would likely raise, along with professional, persuasive responses. Consider the context, industry, and tone of the script.

IMPORTANT: You must generate exactly 5 objections, no more, no less.

Return the response as a JSON array with objects containing:
- objection: The prospect's likely objection (string)
- response: A professional response to handle the objection (string)  
- category: Category of objection like "price", "timing", "need", "authority", "trust", "competitor" (string)
- priority: Priority level "high", "medium", or "low" based on how common this objection would be (string)

Focus on objections that are:
1. Realistic and commonly encountered
2. Relevant to the script content and approach
3. Varied in type (price, timing, need, decision-making authority, etc.)

Example format:
