PRODUCT/SERVICE DESCRIPTION:
"${productDescription}"

COMPANY NAME: ${companyName}
SCRIPT CATEGORY: ${category}

Please create a comprehensive cold calling script that includes:

1. Strong opening that grabs attention
2. Value proposition presentation
3. Discovery questions to engage prospect
4. Benefit statements with examples
5. Objection handling responses
6. Clear call-to-action/next steps
7. Professional closing

The script should:
- Use dynamic placeholders like [name], [company], [my_name], [my_company_name] for personalization
- Be conversational and natural sounding
- Include specific pauses and response handlers
- Be approximately 2-3 minutes when read at normal pace
- Focus on benefits, not just features
- Include social proof or credibility elements

Return the response as a JSON object with:
{
  "name": "Generated script name (max 60 chars)",
  "description": "Brief description of the script (max 150 chars)", 
  "content": "Full script content with placeholders and formatting",

      "category": "price|timing|need|authority|trust|competitor",
      "priority": "high|medium|low"
